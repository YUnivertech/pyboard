        ccc  = _param3 - 5                                   (Not "ccc = param3-5")
        dddd = _param4 - 5                                   (Not "dddd = param4-5")

        sum = ( a * 1 + bb * 2 + ccc * 3 + dddd * 4 )        (Not "(a*1 + bb*2 + ccc*3 + dddd)")
        lst = [ 1, 2 ]                                       (Not "lst = [1, 2]")
